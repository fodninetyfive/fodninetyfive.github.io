i want to be part of it\
motivated to pull it together\
activated by smiles\
energized by laughter, thoughtful exchanges\
eager to augment, afraid to impact\
happy to be there.

a compulsion to capture\
the closest thing to permanence\
memories trick you, moments don’t hang\
the photos you take are the next best thing to proof\
that was real. you were there!\
behind the lens. out of frame.

take a walk and it’s dark out\
make a plan - it’s tomorrow\
take a trip and it’s next week\
overthink and you’ve lost it\
take your time and it takes you\
take your time.
