## energetic, loud, and hopeful

**The Lonely Forest** played their last show together on August 30th, 2014. The air was crisp, the sky was a hazy blue, and the boys were tired. Barely 10 months had passed since they released their last album, but the years since _Arrows_ had worn them out.

_Arrows_ was the result of their work with **Chris Walla**, at the time best known for his role as guitarist and producer for the celebrated and revered Seattle band **Death Cab for Cutie**. **The Lonely Forest**, from the Pacific Northwest themselves, had played a legendary album release show at Seattle's all-ages venue **The Vera Project** for _We Sing the Body Electric_ in the spring of 2009. _We Sing the Body Electric_ captured Walla's attention, prompting him to form an imprint label on **Atlantic Records** called "Trans-" (get it? Trans-Atlantic?) specifically to sign **The Lonely Forest** and record, produce, and release the album that would become _Arrows_.

Tracked in the summer of 2009, _Arrows_ sounded like a band ready to take on the world. It was bright and full of energy, loud and angry, wistful and longing. It starts off with a kind of prayer in "Be Everything" before bursting into the anthemic "Turn Off This Song and Go Outside," the first single from the album, originally released on a teaser EP in the fall of 2009. _Arrows_ is like a rollercoaster, gently climbing upwards before hard-dropping you into loud guitars, pounding rhythms, melancholy keys, dissenting but melodic cries for the future, all before bringing you back home with a hopeful, gentle end. With _Arrows_, the band managed to reach new heights, performing on **Jimmy Kimmel Live**, touring with peers like **Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin** and **Two Door Cinema Club**, and supporting **Death Cab for Cutie** on their _Codes & Keys_ tour.

The years ticked on as their dedicated fanbase waited for signs of new music. In 2013, **The Lonely Forest** embarked on a co-headline tour with **Now, Now** from Minneapolis, who Walla had also signed to Trans-. This tour marked the re-release of their pre-Trans- albums—2007's _Nuclear Winter_ and 2009's aforementioned _We Sing the Body Electric_—with newly formatted artwork and remastered audio. The band played new songs on this tour—and they played them loud—but there was still no news about a new album, and it was not hard to tell that it was wearing on them.

_Adding Up the Wasted Hours_—**The Lonely Forest**'s second release on Trans- and their final album to date—was eventually announced over a year later in August of 2013, just 2 months out from its October release. The lead single "Warm/Happy" sits near the end of the album but boasts a sparkly, dance-y chorus before it goes out with a chant: "we're done waiting/we're done hiding/we are ever-reaching towards the end." They were being honest. The album came together in spite of a number of tumultuous years navigating approvals, contracts, and fine print—an experience all too familiar for bands trying to break into the spotlight. _Adding Up the Wasted Hours_ wasn't technically a sophomore record, but for all intents and purposes, it was exactly that: it was still a **Lonely Forest** record, marked by hopeful lyrics, rolling melodies, and lush, colorful tones, but it was generously topped off with exhaustion, frustration, and longing for the simpler times.

Just half a year and change after the release, in May of 2014, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. They played a few more shows over the following months, including an intimate, penultimate show in their hometown of **Anacortes, WA**, before capping it off with their swan song at **Bumbershoot 2014** on a lovely afternoon. The air was crisp, the sky was a hazy blue, and **John Van Deusen** (vocals, guitar), **Tony Ruland** (guitar), **Eric Sturgeon** (bass), and **Braden Krueger** (drums)—four boys who had grown up together in a little town on a little island—were so tired, but they played their hearts out.

Looking out to the crowd before launching into the last song the band ever played, John told the audience, "For the first time ever—I think I really mean this—this is for you guys." The band closed out their final show with "We Sing in Time," the quintessential Lonely Forest manifesto, the song the band had played more than any other, as they screamed out to a crowd echoing every word back: "Oh in time the trees die and light will fade/but I hope for a new breath, a new life..." 

Energetic, loud, and hopeful for the future—that's **The Lonely Forest**.
