## website for live recordings of The Lonely Forest
****
tools/skills used: HTML, Pixelmator, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop 

****
This is a simple but elegant and functional website I put together to serve as a centralized home for the live recordings I've made (and a few I've produced for release) over the years. The url comes from their biggest hit, **"We Sing in Time"**, which I'd registered early on in my fandom, and was pleased to have figured out a use for.

The site itself is pretty basic - hosted on Tumblr as a backend with a custom domain. At some point I'll probably move it to a more standard webhost, but it's working well for what I need it to do.
