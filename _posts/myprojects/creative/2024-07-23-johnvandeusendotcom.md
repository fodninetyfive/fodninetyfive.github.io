I'm John's *website guy*, and his site has changed a lot over the years.

For the current version, he asked for something very simple: he wanted **a looping video of him sitting in the grass reading a magazine with birds chirping in the background**. I had an interesting time creating the video loop and audio loop and fiddling with what web browsers allow for autoplaying. I added a button to mute and unmute the audio which is muted by default in most cases. I also asked him to draw the buttons himself, which I then scanned and turned into the buttons you see on the page, which expand slightly when you hover over them. **Simple, fun, and tactile**. This iteration of the site is live over at [johnvandeusen.com](johnvandeusen.com).

This website you're on right now (**cdrive.site**) actually started out as an evolution of an idea that I had worked on for John to make a **GeoCities-esque 90s-vibe homepage**, complete with loud Under Construction GIFs, a guestbook, and more. That version of the site was his homepage for a couple years and can still be seen [here on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101065337/https://johnvandeusen.com/). I've included some screenshots down below.

As fun as it was, it wasn't *particularly professional*, and was probably a little bit of a head-scratcher for record label people to see. It lived a good little life and I'm glad we got to do it. The floating Winamp player (which relies on the [Webamp project](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp)) still made it onto **cdrive**, where you'll find it in the [bootlegs section](https://cdrive.site/mymusic/bootlegs/) and maybe other sections, soon...
