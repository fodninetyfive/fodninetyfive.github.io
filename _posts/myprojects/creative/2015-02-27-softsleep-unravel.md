# Soft Sleep - "EP"
## 7 inch vinyl EP artwork, design, and layout
****
tools/skills used: Pixelmator, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop 

****
Tony Ruland reached out to me to **create the cover art, design, and layout for a 7 inch vinyl EP** for a couple songs he had recorded under a new project called "Soft Sleep"—his first release as a solo artist after The Lonely Forest went on hiatus in 2014. This was an exciting opportunity for me—not only would this be **the first cover art I'd created for a physical vinyl release**, but I also got to design the layout for the sleeve and the 7 inch A and B side stickers.

The cover art is made from sliced up stock photos of pills run with destructive adjustments and filters made in Pixelmator. For the back sleeve and A/B stickers, I **taught myself Adobe Illustrator on the fly** and had a lot of fun with the text design.

The songs **feature vocals and instrumentation from Chris Walla—former guitarist and producer for Death Cab for Cutie and a longtime idol of mine**—and were recorded at The Hall of Justice, his studio in Seattle.

The EP was released on Rocket Heart Records and is available for purchase <a href="https://www.rocketheartrecords.com/product/soft-sleep-soft-sleep" target="_blank">physically</a> and <a href="https://softsleep.bandcamp.com/album/soft-sleep-7-ep" target="_blank">digitally</a>.
