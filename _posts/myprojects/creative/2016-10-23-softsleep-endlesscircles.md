# Soft Sleep - "Endless Circles" 
## 12 inch vinyl LP design and layout

tools/skills used: Pixelmator, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop

After doing the art and design work for the Soft Sleep EP, Tony once again reached out when the album was ready. This time he already had some images he wanted to use, so I was tasked with turning those into a **cover design, an inner sleeve layout with the full album lyrics and credits, and the 12-inch A/B side stickers**.

The design for this release was a bit of a departure from what I'd done with the "Unravel" EP. I carried over the bold typefacing and clean layout (I'm a big fan of whitespace and symmetry), but given the simple subject of the images provided, I was able to really lean into the minimalism that I'd dabbled in with the EP. The album title "Endless Circles" gave me a pretty clear circle motif that I worked into the inner sleeve to interrupt the lyrics which you can see in the full design below.

The album was released on Rocket Heart Records and is available for purchase <a href="https://www.rocketheartrecords.com/product/soft-sleep-endless-circles" target="_blank">physically</a> and <a href="https://softsleep.bandcamp.com/album/endless-circles" target="_blank">digitally</a>.

I also was asked to make the covers for the two digital singles that were released in advance of the album, which you can see here:
