After doing the art and design work for the Soft Sleep "Unravel" EP, Tony once again reached out when the album was ready. This time he already had some images he wanted to use, so I was tasked with turning those into a **cover design, an inner sleeve layout with the full album lyrics and credits, and the 12-inch A/B side stickers**. The design for this release was a departure from what I'd done with the "Unravel" EP, but I carried over the font work and expanded upon the minimalism that I'd dabbled in with that release.

The album was released on Rocket Heart Records and is available for purchase <a href="https://www.rocketheartrecords.com/product/soft-sleep-endless-circles" target="_blank">here</a>.
