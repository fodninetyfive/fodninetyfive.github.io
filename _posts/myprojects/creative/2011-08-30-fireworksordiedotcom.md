I made this site at the start of my junionr year of college and kicked it off with an essay about the new Jonathan Coulton album. I'd had other iterations of homepages before, but this one stuck around for a significant amount of time. It even ended up seeing some solid pageviews thanks to a really impressive audience recording I made at Eaux Claires II of Bon Iver premiering their new, as-of-yet unannounced album live in its entirety.

With this site in place I've redirected the URL to point here, but I've backed everything up (the archivist in me) and am working on redistrubuting the creative writing posts and the bootlegs into respective categories here. But for now, I'll leave you with a few screenshots:
