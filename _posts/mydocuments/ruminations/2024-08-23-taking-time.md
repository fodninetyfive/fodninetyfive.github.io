i want to be part of it\
motivated to pull it together\
activated by anticipation\
energized by laughter, thoughtful exchanges\
eager to augment, hesitant to impact.\
happy to be there.

a compulsion to capture\
since permanence is impossible\
memories trick, moments don’t hang\
the records you make are the closest you get\
that was real - you were there!\
behind the lens, out of frame.

take a walk and it’s dark out\
make a plan, it’s tomorrow\
take a trip till it’s next week\
overthink and you’ve lost it\
taking time and it takes you.\
take your time.
