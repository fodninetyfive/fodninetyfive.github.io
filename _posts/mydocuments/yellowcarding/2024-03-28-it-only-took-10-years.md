# it only took 10 years

## and a Mercer to bring it home

****

i’m 33 years old and i think it’s time to finally admit it: i was wrong about _[After the Disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Disco)_ , the follow-up to Broken Bells’(s’s?!) absolutely fucking stellar 2010 self-titled debut. listen:

 _[Broken Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Bells_\(album\))_ was a fucking masterpiece. that album has immaculate vibes. i honestly don’t remember how much preparation i’d had - i’d heard the first single, thought it was neat or something. if i recall correctly, the full album leaked not even a week or two later. a whole new album. boom! escaping into the dirty, melancholy soundscapes was a real treat for something i didn’t even know was going to exist a month prior. it occupies the same space in my head that [The Good, The Bad, & The Queen’s 2007 debut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_%26_the_Queen_\(album\)) (also self-titled) does: floaty, rainy, and cold, but somehow thumpy, and also a long lullabye. i’m trying to think of another album that sits in that same spot and i’m coming up short.

but this isn’t about the debut - _After the Disco_ came out in January 2014, approximately 4 years after i’d first listened obsessively to the first one. and that was a _huge_ 4 years. in January 2010 i was a second-semester college freshman in Ames preparing to retake Calc 1, making it my 6th and ultimately final semester of some form of first-level calculus since junior year of high school. in January 2014 i was half a year into my first big-boy job, living in Chicago above a Jimmy John’s. less math, more smells. it changes a person. but most significantly, the stakes were different: this time, there was _anticipation_ and _expectations,_ two variables completely missing from the first round. oooops - did i do thaaaat?!

i’d been listening to the iTunes sample previews, i’d been getting hyped for the singles, i was following the [strange Kate Mara/Anton Yelchin series of music video/short film things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nq8jkz1rVg). i was pretty wrapped up and the bar was high. when the album finally dropped for an NPR First Listen-type thing i was so excited and i think pretty whelmed. i think it’s actually kind of the first song’s fault - i don’t think the rest of the album really ever hits the high of the exciting descending melodies of “Perfect World”. it’s a pretty huge intro that i still think might have been better suited bringing the album to a close. it was kind of like [“Raging Bull” at Six Flags Great America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_\(roller_coaster\)) where the first huge drop is so big and thrilling that the rest of the peaks and valleys aren’t really all that noteworthy - they’re just kinda there.

but look, man - i’ve been listening more here and there the last couple weeks and i gotta say: it’s actually pretty fucking good. oooops!

i’m not going to dissect song-by-song because it’s fucking 3:45 AM but [the back third of “Control” goes hard](https://youtu.be/q6azqrFDXfY?t=142). it also cleverly (but effectively!) cheats its way out of a full fade-out, which is good, because i can’t think of a single song where i was glad it faded out instead of coming to a full stop. how are you gonna do that live, musicians? dorks. (i didn’t try very hard right now but it’s something i’ve been thinking a lot about for years and promise to do more thoughtfully next time. for now you’ll need to trust me.)

anyways the album goes way harder than i ever gave it credit for and i’ve come around: i actually think it’s a Pretty Fucking Solid Sophomore Record.

Broken Bells released [a third album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Blue_\(Broken_Bells_album\)) a year and change ago and i think i listened to it once. ask me again when i’m 43 and i’ll let you know what i think. it’s just another 10 years - i can change!

anyways, i think that about wraps this up here. substack was a fun run, maybe even a turkey trot. but nazis can fuck off. follow me on [Pownce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pownce). jk i’ll probably just move to a self-hosted blog thing
