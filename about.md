if you've clicked through the site or some of those links you'll recognize the username **fireworksordie**, which i've used since February 2005 when i got an invite to create my first gmail account.<br><br>
there's a livejournal account that i've only recently discovered while googling for more accounts of mine to add here that predated my gmail account by about a year. and while that livejournal ***isn't me***, and i ***won't be linking to it***, it is without a doubt also someone who—over 20 years ago—thought that the graffiti mentioned in the 2003 Strong Bad Email "2 years" was awesome:

<a href="https://youtu.be/d7eePF65T8o?t=76" target="_blank"> <img src="/assets/images/2years.jpg" alt="cover" class="yc-img"> </a>

they curse *way more* than i do, holy cow. and unlike them, i still haven't watched *Mulholland Dr.* (absolutely need to change that) or *American Beauty* (in less of a rush to watch this one), and i'm not obsessed with someone named Spencer. but i do wonder if they're the same person who took my username on the Playstation Network years ago, **forcing me to go with "fireworksordie_" like a *total loser***.

the website you are looking at right now is constantly under construction but always under the same management: me. the site has been hacked to bits from a neat little Windows 95ish theme by <a href="http://github.com/h01000110" target="_blank">h01000110 (hi)</a> provided under an <a href="https://github.com/h01000110/h01000110.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License</a>. i recently decided to give it a little Windows XP spin, and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do. XP was the best. *fight me*.
