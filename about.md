# hi— i'm Christian. thanks for visiting!<br>if you want to go straight to my creative portfolio, click <a href="https://cdrive.site/myprojects/creative/">here</a>.
<br>
i thrive on putting things together that bring joy to people. whether it's something as big as a 400 GB project folder or as small as an email, **my goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact**.

i have a tendency to latch onto weird / overlooked / "someone should do this"-type-projects. i often find that the best ideas are the ones you figured someone might have already done but didn't. a lot of the time those things don't get done because it's a **weird amount of effort** to find all of the pieces of a puzzle, let alone put them together.

every task deserves thoughtful execution. **i take pride in the odds and ends**, ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to ensure the output stands the test of time. i trust my instincts. i have a knack for foresight enriched by anxiety and overthinking. my ability to think through outcomes and plan for workarounds is a force to be reckoned with. **creative problem solving is my favorite thing in the world**.

i will forever be inconsistent about en and em dash usage. why do they not have dedicated keyboard buttons?

the website you are looking at right now is constantly under construction (kind of like Strong Badia) but always under the same management: me. the site has been hacked to bits from a neat little Windows 95ish theme by <a href="http://github.com/h01000110" target="_blank">h01000110 (hi)</a> provided under an <a href="https://github.com/h01000110/h01000110.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License</a>. i recently decided to give it a little Windows XP spin, and i hope you enjoy it as much as i do. XP was *the best*. fight me.
