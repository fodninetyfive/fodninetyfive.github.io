hi - i'm Christian. thanks for visiting. 

i thrive on putting things together that bring joy to people. whether it's something as big as a 400 GB project folder or as small as an email, my goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact.

i look for weird, overlooked, "someone should do this"-type-projects. the best ideas are the ones you figured someone might have already done.

every task deserves thoughtful execution. i take pride in the odds and ends, ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to ensure the output stands the test of time.

i trust my instincts. i have a knack for foresight enriched by anxiety and overthinking. my ability to think through outcomes and plan for workarounds is a force to be reckoned with.
